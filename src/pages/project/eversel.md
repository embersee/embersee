### This is a project made to learn about cloning a marketplace similar to Amazon and Ozon, but with a twist! Instead, visitors can upload items/services they are looking for, and other visitors can preview the needs and desires of other users.

This was my diploma project from college. I earned full marks from each grader.

### Here's a preview of the project:

### Telegram Auth Page:
A requirement for this project was to allow users to not register, but to just instantly login with their Telegram accounts. After clicking, a window will prompt the user to enter their phone number associated with their Telegram account, and after entering they will get a message from the Telegram Authentication Bot asking for access.

Closed for live-preview, as I don't want to mislead anybody registering for a project no-longer in active development.
